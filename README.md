# Weather-Dashboard
An application to show the weather conditions in any city in the world.

When you open this application, you are able to enter a city anywhere in the 
world or choose from your previously searched cities. Whichever you choose, you 
should then be presented with the current weather in that city, as well as the 5 Day forecast. 
The city should also be added to your list of previously searched cities.

When building this, I started with building the HTML, then moved on to taking a value 
from the input box, and getting the current weather for that city. 
Then I worked on populating the 5 day forecast. After all that was working, I added a
feature where the input city would be stored in local storage. Then I moved on to populating buttons
for each city stored in local storage upon opening the page. Then I went back and made it so that
when you press submit, that city is also added to the list. Then finally, i made it so when
you open the page your most recent searched city's weather and forecast are shown. I also had
a clear button and working code for it, but I realized I didn't need it so I commented it out.
